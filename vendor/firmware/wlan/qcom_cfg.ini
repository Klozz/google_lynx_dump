# This ini is used to set RPS map for different RX queues.
#
# List of RPS CPU maps for different rx queues registered by WLAN driver
# Ref - Kernel/Documentation/networking/scaling.txt
# RPS CPU map for a particular RX queue, selects CPU(s) for bottom half
# processing of RX packets. For example, for a system with 4 CPUs,
# 0xe: Use CPU1 - CPU3 and donot use CPU0.
# 0x0: RPS is disabled, packets are processed on the interrupting CPU.
#
# WLAN driver registers NUM_TX_QUEUES queues for tx and rx each during
# alloc_netdev_mq. Hence, we need to have a cpu mask for each of the rx queues.
#
# For example, if the NUM_TX_QUEUES is 4, a sample WLAN ini entry may look like
# rpsRxQueueCpuMapList=a b c d
# For a 4 CPU system (CPU0 - CPU3), this implies:
# 0xa - (1010) use CPU1, CPU3 for rx queue 0
# 0xb - (1011) use CPU0, CPU1 and CPU3 for rx queue 1
# 0xc - (1100) use CPU2, CPU3 for rx queue 2
# 0xd - (1101) use CPU0, CPU2 and CPU3 for rx queue 3
# In practice, we may want to avoid the cores which are heavily loaded.
#
# Default value of rpsRxQueueCpuMapList. Different platforms may have
# different configurations for NUM_TX_QUEUES and # of cpus, and will need to
# configure an appropriate value via ini file. Setting default value to 'e' to
# avoid use of CPU0 (since its heavily used by other system processes) by rx
# queue 0, which is currently being used for rx packet processing.
#
# Maximum length of string used to hold a list of cpu maps for various rx
# queues. Considering a 16 core system with 5 rx queues, a RPS CPU map
# list may look like -
# rpsRxQueueCpuMapList = ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff
# (all 5 rx queues can be processed on all 16 cores)
# max string len = 24 + 1(for '\0'). Considering 30 to be on safe side.
